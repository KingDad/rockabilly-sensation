					<h3>About Brenna Joyce</h3>
					<p>
“Mika pulled her tawny hood further down over her face, a nervous habit that wasn’t entirely her own.”
The first sentence of Brenna Joyce’s new novel Fallen Among the Folk, introduces the main character Mika, but also the author and musician herself. Brenna Joyce is experimenting with fusing fantasy fiction and music, two passions she’s held dear to her heart since childhood. She’s completely new to writing fiction, but experienced in music, so just like her character Mika, she’s an expert venturing into unfamiliar territory. Although untried in writing, her creativity guided her through the process, letting her ideas take shape in a raw and unexpected way.
</p>
<p>
            This is Brenna Joyce’s first attempt at fiction, but she worked successfully as a professional local musician for seven years prior to that. She worked every single weekend, often with multiple gigs a day, for that entire period. Brenna started working at fourteen, so she gave up a lot of adolescent experiences in order to perform live and become a better musician. This conviction to her passion led her to play at the Odium in Greenwich Rhode Island to hundreds of fans, as well as appear on local radio and TV. After high school, she continued pursuing music and attended Berklee College of Music where she honed her performance skills and learned everything she could about music theory. Although she has left the band she used to perform with Daddy-O! she still guest stars for some gigs. A recent gig was a Boston Marathon Fundraiser at the Harvard Club.
					</p>
          <p>Lately, Brenna has turned her attention away from performance and instead focused on both fiction writing and songwriting. She’s writing a fantasy novel, tentatively called Fallen Among the Folk, which follows a human woman named Mika who is crossing the cultural boundaries of her fantastical world to try to broker peace between the humans like herself and the magical Fae that rule the land. Due to humans in this world remembering all their previous lives, she struggles with the actions of her past. But she is supported throughout the adventure by the gaggle of ridiculous yet charming Fae friends. The story can only be enhanced by the funny, catchy folk tunes that Brenna writes for her characters. She’s also working on a full soundtrack to accompany the reader throughout the story, following the pace of the reader (if they read digitally).</p>
